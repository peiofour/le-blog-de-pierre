# hello, friend

My name is __Pierre Fournier__.

I'm a __programmer__.

![DJ Snake - J'ai une histoire, j'ai un background.](https://res.cloudinary.com/pierrefournier-dev/image/upload/v1643112597/about/djsnake_d6vk8p.jpg)

I'm __24__, I live in __Toulouse city__, in the south of France, and I'm coming from Basque country.

I am passionate with many things including photography, tech things, movies, sports, politics, history and astronomy.

On this site, which also serves as my blog, I share about my passions, I make them interact between them. I also write about my projects, as well as my travels. I will develop later a portofolio to present my creations.

I coded some personal projects that you can find on [my Github](https://github.com/peiofour).

You can find my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dvp0DcD2fGJngpLkihoVImSJ4jRxFh2X/view?usp=sharing).

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/pierrefournier1).

You can send me an email on <pierre.fournier@protonmail.com> or DM on [Telegram](https://t.me/superbasque).
